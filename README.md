FibonacciGenerator Documentation
-------------------------------

Introduction:
--------------
The FibonacciGenerator is a Java program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given input number. It uses the BigInteger class to handle large numbers accurately and provides a user-friendly interface to enter numbers and obtain the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

Usage:
--------
1. The program prompts the user to enter a number or type 'exit' to quit.
2. If a positive integer is entered, the program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number and displays it.
3. If 'exit' is entered, the program terminates.
4. If an invalid input (non-integer or non-positive) is provided, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a valid input.

Code Structure:
------------------
The code is organized into a single class named FibonacciGenerator. It consists of the following methods:

1. main(String[] args): The main entry point of the program. It handles user input, validates it, and generates the Fibonacci sequence.

2. generateFibonacciSequence(BigInteger number): A helper method that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number. It returns a List of BigIntegers representing the sequence.

Key Features:
----------------
1. Input Validation: The program validates user input to ensure it is a positive integer. It displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

2. BigInteger Handling: The program uses the BigInteger class to handle large numbers accurately, avoiding integer overflow issues encountered with the int data type.

3. Modular Code: The code is modular, with a separate method for generating the Fibonacci sequence. This promotes code reuse and improves code readability.

4. Graceful Error Handling: The program gracefully handles errors such as invalid input or exceptions and provides meaningful error messages to the user.

5. User-Friendly Interface: The program provides a simple and intuitive interface for the user to enter numbers and obtain the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

Optimization:
----------------
The program optimizes the generation of the Fibonacci sequence by using the BigInteger class to handle large numbers efficiently. It avoids crashes due to integer overflow and ensures accurate sequence generation.

Conclusion:
---------------
The FibonacciGenerator program is a reliable and efficient solution for generating Fibonacci sequences. It handles large numbers accurately and provides a user-friendly interface for obtaining Fibonacci sequences for various input numbers.

The SQL query `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 AND salary > 50000;` retrieves all employees from the "employees" table whose age is above 30 and salary is above $50,000. It filters the rows based on these conditions, providing a result set of employees that meet the specified criteria. The query is concise, readable, and demonstrates a good understanding of SQL syntax and concepts.

 * 
The bug in the given code lies in the calculation of the average. 
The variable total is an integer, and when dividing it by numbers.length, the result is also an integer. This causes the decimal part of the average to be truncated, leading to an incorrect result. To fix this, we need to perform the division using floating-point arithmetic. Here's the corrected code:
 */



/*
 * In the corrected code, we explicitly cast total to a 
 * double before dividing it by numbers.length. 
 * This ensures that the division is performed using floating-point arithmetic, 
 * preserving the decimal part of the average. 
 * The corrected code is well-structured, modular, and readable. 
 * The bug is addressed, and the code now correctly calculates and displays the average.
